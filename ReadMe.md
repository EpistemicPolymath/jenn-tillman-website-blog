# About this Project

Although, I am very interested in JAMStack websites, HTML, CSS, PHP, JQuery, etc are still good tools for basic websites. I wanted to use this BootStrap Made Template to re-design my professional website as another alternative to website structure and design and to be able to manage my own website without an external service such as about.me.
