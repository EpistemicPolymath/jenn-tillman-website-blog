# About this Project

Although, I am very interested in JAMStack websites, I wanted to use this BootStrap Made Template to re-design my professional website as another alternative to website structure and design and to be able to manage my own website without an external service such as about.me. I customized this template a lot in order to get it working and hosted with GitHub Pages. It has been an interesting learning experiment so far and I am happy with the results of the website.
